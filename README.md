# Hi! I'm Mohit Singh, a BTech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

I'm passionate about software development and I'm currently learning *Java*, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript*. I'm eager to become a full-stack web developer and I'm using this GitHub repo to showcase my skills and projects.

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

A simple to-do list app in Java
A website for my school using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
A web application that uses a database to store data
I'm always looking for new challenges and I'm excited to learn more about software development. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub repo!
