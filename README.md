# Hi! I'm Mohit Singh, a BTech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

I'm passionate about software development and I'm currently learning **Java, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**. I'm eager to become a full-stack web developer and I'm using this GitHub repo to showcase my skills and projects.

Here are some of the projects I've worked on along with their live link:

A Password Generator -> https://mohiitsingh.github.io/PasswordGenerator/

A website for online courses using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript -> https://mohiitsingh.github.io/schoolWebsite/

I'm always looking for new challenges and I'm excited to learn more about software development. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub repo!
